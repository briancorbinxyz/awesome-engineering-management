- [Leaders Eat Last](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144853-leaders-eat-last) by Simon Sinek

- [Emotional Intelligence 2.0](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6486483-emotional-intelligence-2-0) by Travis Bradberry & Jean Greaves

  <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328765863i/6486483.jpg" alt="Emotional Intelligence 2.0" width="150"/>

  > “Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships.”

  > “The secret to winning this culture game is to treat others how they want to be treated, not how you would want to be treated.”

  > “Some of the most challenging and stressful situations people face are at work. Conflicts at work tend to fester when people passively avoid problems, because people lack the skills needed to initiate a direct, yet constructive conversation. Conflicts at work tend to explode when people don’t manage their anger or frustration, and choose to take it out on other people. Relationship management gives you the skills you need to avoid both scenarios, and make the most out of every interaction you have with another person.”

  > “Software projects can be thought of as having two distinct stages: figuring out what to build (build the right product), and building it (building the product right). The first stage is dominated by product discovery, and the second stage is all about execution.”

  > “Keep the focus on minimal product...your job as product manager is not to define the ultimate product, it’s to define the smallest possible product that will meet your goals.”

  > "The Objectives and Key Results (OKR) technique is a tool for management, focus, and alignment. As with any tool, there are many ways to use it.

  Habits, follow a four-step process: “Cue, craving, response and reward.” Cues are the activators; cravings are the motivators. Responses are the answers that yield a reward.

  > “This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits — a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.”

  > “Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.”

  > “We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful.”
